"""
MetaHiC pipeline for generating and manipulating MAGs.

usage:
    metator [-hv] <command> [<args>...]

options:
    -h, --help              shows the help
    -v, --version           shows the version

The subcommands are:
    network     Generate metaHiC contigs network from fastq reads or bam files
                and normalize it.
    partition   Partition metaHiC network using Louvain or Leiden algorithm.
    pipeline    Use all the others command to give a binned output in one
                command line.
    validation  Validates bins using CheckM and make a recursive partition to
                try to decontaminate them.
    qc          Generates some quality check on the output of metator.
    contactmap  Generates a HiC contact map from one metaTOR object from the
                final ouptut of metaTOR.
    scaffold    Scaffold a metator bin based on pairs files.
    pairs       Sort the pairs file using pairtools. Compress them using bgzip.
                Index them using pypairix.
    host        Detect bacterial host from a metaHiC network binned by metaTOR
                given a annotated MGE list.
    mge         Build MGE MAGs based on metagenomic binning using metabat2
                or pairs from the metaHiC data.
